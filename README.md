# McLeod Portfolio

## Requirements

* Navigation with React Router, dynamic rendering, or another third part router

* Deploy this site to GitHub Pages using the [Create React App docs for deployment.](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages)

* **Important**: Be sure to push your codebase to GitHub and **NOT** your built and deployed code. Ensure this happens by following the above instructions and using the `gh-pages` branch to host the deployed application's code.

### Updated Portfolio

Your updated site should still have all of the content it previously had:

* A link to a PDF of your resume with updated projects

### React

* **Important**: If you use React Router, you will **NOT** be able to use the `<BrowserRouter>` component on GitHub Pages. Read the [GitHub note on client-side routing](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#notes-on-client-side-routing) and the [React Router documentation on HashRouter](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/HashRouter) for more information.
